Privacy Policy; End User License Agreement; Additional Terms
Privacy Policy. Please read the Noti-fly Privacy Policy carefully for information relating to our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information. The Noti-fly Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.
End User License Agreement. Your use of any mobile application or other downloadable software we may provide (each, an "App") is subject to an End User License Agreement. The applicable End User License Agreement depends on the platform on which the App is designed to run and the features of the App. The End User License Agreement will be presented to you when you download and/or install the App and will be accessible through the App. Apps are deemed part of the Service, and all such End User License Agreements are hereby incorporated into, and made a part of, the Terms by reference.
Additional Terms. Your use of the Service is subject to any additional terms, rules, or guidelines applicable to certain services and features which we may post from time to time (the "Additional Terms"). All such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, the Terms.
Modification of the Terms. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change the Terms on a going forward basis at any time. Please check the Terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Service after the changes become effective constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes. In the event that a change to the Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, we will make an effort to notify you of the change, such as by sending you an email to the address we have on file for you, or presenting a pop-up window or other notification to you through the Service when you log in. Immaterial modifications are effective upon publication, and material changes will be effective upon the earlier of (a) continued use of the Service with actual knowledge of the modification, or (b) thirty (30) days following the change. For the avoidance of doubt, disputes arising hereunder will be resolved in accordance with the Terms in effect that the time the dispute arose.
Accounts and Registration. To access most features of the Service you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself (such as your e-mail address or other contact information). You agree that the information you provide to us is and will be accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure for any reason (for example, in the event of a loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of your password), then you agree to notify us immediately by submitting a ticket from within the app or visiting our Help Center. If you are unable to log-in to the Help Center please send an email to accountsupport@Noti-fly.com.
User Rewards.
User Rewards Generally. Noti-fly makes available through the Service offers on certain third-party products and services (each an "Offer"). When you redeem an Offer through the Service, you will accumulate rewards in your Noti-fly account ("Rewards"). Each Offer may be subject to Additional Terms and may be discontinued by Noti-fly at any time. At any time and in Noti-fly's sole discretion, Noti-fly may: (i) determine whether or not you are eligible to redeem an Offer; (ii) determine whether or not you have earned Rewards; or (iii) adjust your Rewards total. Prior to distribution, Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any cash, money, or anything of value in exchange for your Rewards total except as made available by Noti-fly under Section 5.2. `,
